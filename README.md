# Tensors-Analytics2.0

This project was a part of the work done in a Hackathon conducted by Orient Bell Tiles.
This was a team project done collaboratively with - [Sandeep Pattanayak](https://github.com/PSandeepSandy) and [Supriya](https://github.com/supr1ya)


This is the interactive portal designed for real world problems which corporates face like -

## 1. Identification of appropriate target audience for a new product.
   
   The proper identification of target audience facilitates targeted advertising, thus, maximising the effectiveness and impact of the advertising expenditures.
   This has an added cost cutting benefit as with a list of targeted audience, the advertising can be much more personalised.
   
   A glimpse at the functioning Top Customer Prediction portal -
   The customisable slider on the top allows the user to adjust size of the target audience.

## 2. Clustering of customers into similar groups

   This helps in identifying the customers behaviour pattern and their taste which then facilitates the personalisation of products specific to certain clusters.
    
   Various behavioural patterns like buying frequency, similarity between items bought, quantity of items bought etc were considered to segregate the entire customer base into clusters.
